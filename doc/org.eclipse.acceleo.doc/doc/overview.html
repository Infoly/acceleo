   <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Acceleo">Acceleo</a> is an implementation of the Object Management Group (OMG) MOF Model to Text Language (MTL) standard.
</p>
<p>
This component is an entirely new development of the OMG MOF <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/MOFM2T/1.0/"> Model to Text</a> (Mof2Text) language. The implementation will be compliant with the
core feature compliance level of the Mof2Text language to start with, then with the advanced
feature compliance.

Each document of the documentation set shipped with this plug-in deals with a different aspect of mastering Acceleo.
