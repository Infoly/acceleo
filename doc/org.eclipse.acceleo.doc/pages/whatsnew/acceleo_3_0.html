        </div>
        <p>
          Acceleo 3.0 is on its way out. The complete list of improvements and bug fixes that have been implemented in this
          version since the last stable release (version 0.8.1, see this post for explanation on this branch's version
          numbering) is humongous; following is the list of the most important ones. I may be succinct on the description
          of some of these, but you can get a full explanation of all of them in the Acceleo documentation, namely the User Guide.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="section2">
        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>Compatibility and upgrading</h1>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Acceleo 3.0 is compatible with the three latest releases of Eclipse; Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede), Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo)
            and Eclipse 3.6 (Helios). However, there are some limitations to this compatibility we maintain due to the changes
            that were implemented in OCL since then. For one, Acceleo modules that compile in Helios may or may not compile in
            Galileo and Ganymede (this will depend on the OCL features you make use of). However, Acceleo modules that compile
            in a given version will always compile in the subsequent Eclipse releases. Likewise, a module that has been compiled
            in Helios may be launched in Ganymede regardless of whether it would compile or not in that version, as our runtime
            shouldn't suffer from OCL breakages and improvements. All information about the compatibility will be maintained
            on the wiki.
          </li>
          <li>
            We provide migration facilities for those of you that own Acceleo 2 templates. Specifically, we allow for the automatic
            migration of Acceleo 2 generation projects to Acceleo 3 projects. The automatic migration takes care of everything
            that could possibly be automated, leaving for you to fix no more than the Acceleo 2 features that don't have an
            identified mapping to Acceleo 3, or those few features that require a human hand to convert intelligently. The team
            is at your disposal for help if there still remains things you don't know how to convert to Acceleo 3 on the usual
            communication channels : the M2T newsgroup, mails, comments on this blog...

          <h1>Compatibility and upgrading</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          New views have been introduced to help you on several aspects of the generation cycles : module definition, launching,
          debugging. I'll detail each of these views one after the other.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First of all, the Result view allows you to get feedback on the traceability information we could retrieve during the
            evaluation of your modules. As long as this view has been opened, Acceleo will record every bit of information it can
            to synchronize your generated text with the generation module and source model. Ever wondered why such or such portion
            of text has been generated one way or another? What part of your generation module has generated the name of such or
            such method? From which element of your model has been generated such or such import? This is the view you can use to
            retrieve these pieces of information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next comes the Overrides view, which can be used to easily create templates or modules overriding other that are present
            in your instance of Eclipse. It will display every single module located either in your installed plug-ins or your workspace.
            All of these can be browsed down to the template level and a check box allows you to select those you wish to override. Once
            selected, you simply have to use the content assistant in the Acceleo Editor (CTRL+SPACE by default) and validate selected
            overrides for all of the overriding templates to be added to your module.
          </li>
          <li>
            Last but not least, the Generation Patterns view has been introduced to help you implement behavior for an interface/class
            and all (or a subset of) its subtypes. For example, let's say you wish to implement a template named javaName which will
            generate the name of any classifier. This template will need some default behavior for interfaces and specific behavior
            for some classifiers. Open the Generation Patterns view, tick [template] for all selected types in its top part, and all
            of the types you wish to generate a template for in its bottom part. Once done, the content assist in the Acceleo editor
            will give you the choice [template] for all selected types which yo just have to choose in order to generate all of the
            templates you asked for. Now that you no longer risk forgetting one or more subtypes, it is left to your discretion to
            implement the behavior for each of them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acceleo now provides a built-in profiler that can be used to keep track of evaluations and identify (and, hopefully, fix)
            bottlenecks in your generation process. The profiler is accessible through a right click on the module which execution you
            need to profile and the menu item Profile As => Acceleo Application.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Acceleo debugger now provides you with the list of available variables at a given point in the evaluation process, along
            with the values of these variables for a given stack frame. Moreover, the displayed stack frames now represent Acceleo module
            element corresponding to your current expression stack. As for the previous release, debugging templates only requires you to
            set breakpoints in the Acceleo modules as you would usually with Eclipse : open an editor, double click in the left margin on
            the line you wish the breakpoint to be set, and launch the generation through the menu Debug As => Launch Acceleo Application.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whenever possible, the warnings and errors Acceleo logs when an evaluation fails now sport the expression stack (with the
            lines they're at in the module files) instead of a stack trace corresponding to the Java code that was being executed at
            the time. This will allow for way easier debugging that ever before.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <h1>Editor Improvements</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          Apart from the performance improvements and minor bug fixes, the Acceleo module editor now provides refactoring actions and
          quick fixes.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First of all, you can now use the "usual" shortcut ALT+SHIFT+R to rename either modules, templates, queries, variables, ...
            in a coherent manner. This very same action can be accessed from right-clicking and selecting Refactor => Rename. The 
            interface will allow you to preview the changes before validating them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Portions of the module elements can be extracted as new templates through right-clicking and selecting Refactor => Extract
            Template (or simply using the shortcut ALT+SHIFT+T). Do note, however, that the selected text needs to be consistent. You
            cannot randomly select text that spans blocks of code and expect an adequate result.
          </li>
          <li>
            The module editor now highlights all occurrences of the selected element when you click on it. For exemple if you place the
            cursor on the name of a template, all invocations of this template will be highlighted and markers will appear on the right
            ruler of the editor to indicate them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acceleo now provide quick fixes for some of the syntax errors detected in the editor, notably the possibility to create
            template or queries of a corresponding name.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is recommended to use a bottom-up approach when developing generators ; Acceleo now eases this process by allowing you
            to initialize the content of a generation module with an example, and offering specific actions to transform these examples
            (static text) in dynamic OCL expressions. For example, changing all occurrences of MyClass to [c.name.toUpperFirst()/] in a
            single click.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section id="section5">
        <div class="page-header">
          <h1>Improvements and simplifications of the language</h1>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The MTL specification defines a standard library that offers a set of utility operations; in addition, Acceleo provides a
            non standard library to provide operations that greatly simplify the language and allow you to write more concise expressions,
            but are not part of the specification. This library has seen many additions since the 0.8 version, with things like
            Collections::sep(String) to insert a separator in-between every element contained by a collection, String::matches(String)
            to check whether a given String matches a regular expression, Collection::filter(Type) that can be used to filter out of a
            collection all elements that are not instances of a given type, Collection::reverse() to reverse the content of a given
            Collection... Take a look at the Acceleo documentation for a full reference of both standard and non standard library, along
            with the reference of the OCL standard library.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acceleo allows you to alter the build mode, either Strict or Lax MTL compliance. Strict compliance meaning you'll get a warning
            for each use of a "non standard" operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Those of you that are familiar with the 2.x stream of Acceleo will be pleased to know that Acceleo 3 now provides the same
            post-processing facilities as its ancestor through the addition of a post directive on templates. Which allows for the
            modification of the text generated by a template "after generation". For example, post(trim()) allows you to properly indent
            the content of the template while still leaving you the possibility to trim all unnecessary white spaces from the generated
            text.
          </li>
          <li>
            The "+" operator can now be used whenever one of the operands is a String for concatenation, in order to avoid the verbose
            concat(String) OCL offers.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can now use properties files to customize your generations through the addition of 4 variants of a getProperty operation
            in Acceleo 3. Once again, the operation reference can be looked at for the description of those services.
          </li>
          <li>
            We made use of the facilities OCL provides in order to further simplify the navigation language : iterators of our [for] blocks
            are no longer mandatory (they'll be implicitly declared if needed and self can be used in their stead), you no longer need
            qualified names for your types when the metamodel is declared on the module header (or if it can be inferred from another of
            the declared metamodels), casting through oclAsType for all redundant expressions is no longer necessary...
          </li>
          <li>
            For those expressions where OCL doesn't allow us to simplify the language, we added non standard operations. For example,
            sequence->select(oclIsKindOf(Type)).oclAsType(Type) is obviously redundant, but OCL doesn't allow for this expression not
            to define the explicit cast. In Acceleo, you can now write sequence->filter(Type) instead (see also the post on this specific
            issue).
          </li>
          <li>
            Acceleo now allows for control characters (\n, \t, \'...) in OCL expressions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Acceleo [for] blocks now declare an implicit "i" variable that can be used to retrieve the iteration count. For example,
            [for (Sequence{4, 5, 6})][i/], [/for] will generate 1, 2, 3.
          </li>
